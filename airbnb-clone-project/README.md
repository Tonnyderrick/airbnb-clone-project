**Airbnb Clone – Backend**

This project is a backend clone of the Airbnb platform, designed to simulate core functionalities such as user authentication, property listings, bookings, and payments. It's built with scalability and modularity in mind, using Django and RESTful API standards.

## Project Objectives

Recreate key features of Airbnb for learning and prototyping.

Build a secure, scalable backend for a booking platform.

Support APIs for frontend integration and mobile clients. Key Features

User Management: Register, login, and manage profiles securely.

Property Listings: Create, update, delete, and browse properties.

Booking System: Book stays, cancel, and view history.

Payment Processing: Simulate payments and transaction records.

Reviews: Leave and manage property reviews and ratings.

REST API: Fully documented endpoints with OpenAPI/Swagger.

Team Roles Tonny Derick - Backend developer

## Responsibilities:
Design and implement RESTful API endpoints.
Develop business logic for bookings, user management, payments, etc.
Ensure API security, scalability, and performance.
Collaborate closely with frontend and database teams.

## Technology Stack

This project utilizes a modern and scalable technology stack to deliver robust backend functionality and seamless data handling.

### Django
- **Purpose**: Django is a high-level Python web framework used to rapidly build secure and maintainable web applications. In this project, Django serves as the core framework for handling HTTP requests, defining models, managing user sessions, and more.

###  Django REST Framework (DRF)
- **Purpose**: DRF extends Django to make it easier to build RESTful APIs. It handles serialization, authentication, and view logic to enable smooth interaction between the frontend and backend.

###  PostgreSQL
- **Purpose**: A powerful open-source relational database system used to store structured data such as users, property listings, bookings, and reviews.

###  GraphQL
- **Purpose**: GraphQL is used as an alternative to REST for more flexible and efficient data querying. It allows clients to request exactly the data they need in a single API call.

###  Celery
- **Purpose**: Celery is used for handling asynchronous tasks like sending confirmation emails, processing payments, or scheduling background jobs.

###  Redis
- **Purpose**: Redis is used alongside Celery for task queue management and as a cache to improve response times and reduce database load.

###  Docker
- **Purpose**: Docker helps package the application and its dependencies into containers, ensuring consistency across development, testing, and production environments.

###  CI/CD Pipelines (e.g., GitHub Actions)
**Purpose**: CI/CD automates testing, building, and deployment of the application whenever changes are made, improving developer productivity and software quality.

 ## Database Design
The application will use a relational database to manage key entities. Below are the main tables and their relationships.

Entities and Key Fields
 Users
id (Primary Key)

name

email

password_hash

user_type (e.g., host, guest)

Relationships:

A user can own multiple properties.

A user can make multiple bookings.

A user can write multiple reviews.

A user can make multiple payments.

Properties
id (Primary Key)

user_id (Foreign Key → Users)

title

description

location

Relationships:

Each property belongs to a user (host).

A property can have multiple bookings.

A property can receive multiple reviews.

Bookings
id (Primary Key)

user_id (Foreign Key → Users)

property_id (Foreign Key → Properties)

start_date

end_date

Relationships:

A booking is made by a user (guest) for a property.

A booking can be associated with one payment.

## Reviews
id (Primary Key)

user_id (Foreign Key → Users)

property_id (Foreign Key → Properties)

rating

comment

Relationships:

A review is written by a user for a property.

## Payments
id (Primary Key)

user_id (Foreign Key → Users)

booking_id (Foreign Key → Bookings)

amount

payment_date

Relationships:

A payment is made by a user for a specific booking.

## Feature Breakdown
This section outlines the core features of the Airbnb Clone project and how each contributes to the functionality of the platform.

User Management
Users can register, log in, and manage their profiles. Depending on their role (guest or host), users can list properties or make bookings.

Property Management
Hosts can list new properties by providing details such as title, description, location, and price. They can also update or delete listings as needed.

Booking System
Guests can view property availability and make bookings for specific dates. The system ensures that double-booking is avoided and allows guests to view their booking history.

Reviews & Ratings
After completing a stay, guests can leave reviews and rate the property. This feature helps maintain transparency and trust among users.

Payment Integration
The platform allows users to securely pay for bookings. Payment records are stored and linked to bookings and users for tracking and reporting.

## API Security
Security is a fundamental part of the backend design for the Airbnb Clone. The following key measures will be implemented to protect user data and ensure a safe, reliable experience.

Authentication
Users must log in using secure credentials to access protected routes. This ensures that only verified users can perform actions like booking properties or making payments.

Authorization
Role-based access control will restrict certain actions to specific user types (e.g., only hosts can create listings). This prevents misuse of features and maintains platform integrity.

## Rate Limiting
APIs will enforce rate limiting to protect against brute-force attacks and abuse. This helps preserve server resources and enhances system stability.

## Data Encryption
Sensitive data such as passwords will be hashed before storage, and all traffic will be secured with HTTPS. This protects against eavesdropping and data breaches.

Secure Payment Handling
Payments will be processed using a secure and trusted third-party gateway. This ensures financial data is not directly exposed to the backend, reducing liability and fraud risks.

Security is essential to protect user data, build trust, and prevent unauthorized access to the system. Without these measures, the platform would be vulnerable to data leaks, account takeovers, and financial fraud.

## CI/CD Pipeline
Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines are automated workflows that help streamline the software development process. They automatically test, build, and deploy code every time changes are made, ensuring that new updates are safe, stable, and delivered quickly.

Why CI/CD is Important
Improves Code Quality: Automated testing catches bugs early before they reach production.

Speeds Up Deployment: Changes can be delivered faster and more reliably with fewer manual steps.

Promotes Team Collaboration: Developers can integrate their code regularly, reducing merge conflicts and improving workflow.

Tools to Use
GitHub Actions: Automates testing, linting, and deployment processes directly from the GitHub repository.

Docker: Ensures consistent environments across development, testing, and production.

Heroku / Netlify / AWS: Can be used as deployment platforms to host the final application.
